# Deep Learning from Scratch - Practice

This repository contains my code implementations and learning notes based on the **"Deep Learning from Scratch"** book series by O'Reilly Japan / 사이토 고키.  
The goal is to **implement deep learning concepts from first principles** using only NumPy and Python, without relying on high-level frameworks.
