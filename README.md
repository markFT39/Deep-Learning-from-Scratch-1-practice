# Deep Learning from Scratch - Practice

This repository contains my code implementations and learning notes based on the **"Deep Learning from Scratch"** book series by O'Reilly Japan / ÏÇ¨Ïù¥ÌÜ† Í≥†ÌÇ§.  
The goal is to **implement deep learning concepts from first principles** using only foundational libraries such as NumPy, without relying on high-level frameworks.

## üìò Book Series
- **Deep Learning from Scratch (1)**  
  Focus: Fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning using NumPy.  
  Repository code ‚Üí `Ch01`, `Ch02`, ...

- **Deep Learning from Scratch (2)**  
  Focus: Natural Language Processing (NLP) from scratch (word embeddings, RNNs, etc.).  
  Repository code ‚Üí `DLFS2/Ch01`, `DLFS2/Ch02`, ...

- **Deep Learning from Scratch (3)** *(to be added)*  
  Planned focus: Reinforcement learning concepts and implementations.

- **Deep Learning from Scratch (4)** *(to be added)*  
  Planned focus: Advanced generative models and further applications.
